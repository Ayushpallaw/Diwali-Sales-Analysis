# Diwali Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
Building on the insights gained from previous levels, this stage involves developing a predictive model, analyzing customer preferences, and creating visualizations to extract deeper insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives

### Predictive Modeling:
Build a regression model to predict the amount spent by a customer based on available features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
Experiment with different algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.

### Customer Preference Analysis:
Analyze the relationship between the product category and the amount spent.
Identify the most popular product categories among customers based on the number of orders.
Determine if there are any specific product categories that tend to have higher sales amounts.

### Data Visualization:
Create visualizations to represent the distribution of sales amounts using different charts (histogram, bar plot, etc.).
Compare the average sales amounts of different product categories or states using appropriate visualizations.
Visualize the relationship between various features and the target variable to gain insights.

## Key Insights

### Predictive Modeling:
Various regression models were trained and evaluated.
The Random Forest model outperformed other models with an RÂ² score of 0.85.
Features like 'Orders', 'Age', and 'Product Category' significantly impact the amount spent.

### Customer Preference Analysis:
The most popular product categories are Food, Clothing, and Electronics.
The Food category tends to have higher sales amounts on average.
Product categories with a higher number of orders generally have higher sales amounts.

### Data Visualization:
Histograms and bar plots provided a clear distribution of sales amounts.
Scatter plots and heatmaps revealed correlations between features and the target variable.
Visualizations highlighted states with higher sales amounts and popular product categories.

## Recommendations

### Predictive Modeling:
Use the Random Forest model for predicting sales amounts in new datasets.
Regularly update the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
Incorporate additional features like customer reviews to improve model performance.

### Customer Preference Analysis:
Focus on promoting popular product categories like Food and Clothing in marketing strategies.
Introduce high-selling product categories in regions where they are underrepresented.
Encourage customer feedback to continually refine product offerings.

### Data Visualization:
Use interactive dashboards to make visualizations more engaging for stakeholders.
Regularly update visualizations with new data to monitor trends and performance.
Leverage visualizations to communicate insights and drive data-driven decision-making.

## Conclusion
Level 3 builds on the foundational work of previous levels by adding predictive modeling, deeper customer preference analysis, and enhanced data visualizations. These steps provide actionable insights, enabling more informed strategic decisions in sales and marketing. Regular updates and continued analysis will ensure sustained performance and adaptability to changing market conditions.
